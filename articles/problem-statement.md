# Problem Statement

## Current RAS algorithm:

``` math
LPRS_i = \sum_{j=1}^{m} X_{ij} \hat{\beta}_j
```
Where in a specific window of $`m`$ SNPs, it calculates a Localized
Polygenic Risk Score (LPRS) for each individual $`i`$. $`X_{ij}`$ is the
genotype dosage of individual $`i`$ at SNP $`j`$, and $`\hat{\beta}_j`$
is the marginal effect size of SNP $`j`$ estimated from the training
split.

It then tests the joint significance by taking the vector of LPRS values
outputted and runs a regression against the vector of actual phenotypes.
The p-value is calculated to determine if the slope of this regression
line is statistically significant.

## Summary Statistic Equivalent:

Given vector of marginal Z-scores for the $`m`$ SNPs in the window:
``` math
Z = (Z_1, Z_2, ..., Z_m)^T
```

To make sure $`Z`$ is a valid replacement for the original individual
data, summary statistics must be generated from target-cohort GWAS that
was adjusted for the same set of covariates (age, sex, etc.) used in the
original model ($`y \sim \text{LPRS} + X`$).

Let $`R`$ be the $`m \times m`$ Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) correlation
matrix of these SNPs, which can be estimated from an external reference
(e.g., 1000 Genomes). $`R`$ must be ancestry-matched.

Let $`w = (w_1, w_2, ..., w_m)^T`$ be vector of weights derived from
training data. Similar to original algorithm, $`w`$ contains the SNP
marginal effect sizes ($`\hat{\beta}`$) from standard GWAS procedures
ran on the training split.

Under null hypothesis ($`H_0`$) of the SNP window having absolutely no
effect on phenotype, a multivariate normal distribution can be created
from this Z-score vector (assuming large enough target-cohort $`N`$ for
this approximation to hold).
``` math
Z \sim N(0, R)
```

## The Test Statistic:

Current `ras_scan` algorithm needs single p-value for whole window, not
`m` different Z-scores, so these `m` dimensions have to be compressed
down to a single number.

Instead of a multi-degree-of-freedom test, the marginal Z-scores are
projected onto the weight vector $`w`$ to form a 1 degree-of-freedom
localized weighted burden statistic. Instead of estimating joint effects
(already in $`w`$), the correlation matrix $`R`$ is used only to account
for linkage disequilibrium (LD) when evaluating the null distribution of
the weighted burden statistic.

Equation:
``` math
T_{\text{burden}} = \frac{w^T Z}{\sqrt{w^T R w}}
```

- $`T_{\text{burden}}`$ is the calculated 1 d.f. burden test statistic
- $`w^T Z`$ is the dot product of the weights and the marginal Z-scores
  (the summary-stat version of the LPRS calculation)
- $`\sqrt{w^T R w}`$ is the std deviation (sqrt of the Quadratic Form)
  of this weighted sum, adjusting for correlation structure defined by
  the LD matrix $`R`$

With $`T_{\text{burden}}`$ calculated, under the null hypothesis it
follows a standard normal distribution:
``` math
T_{\text{burden}} \sim N(0, 1)
```

The two-tailed window p-value can be calculated analytically with the
standard normal cumulative distribution function ($`\Phi`$):
``` math
p = 2(1 - \Phi(|T_{\text{burden}}|))
```

The RAS is simply $`-log_{10}(p-value)`$.

## Quality Control/Regularization:

1.  **Quadratic Form Stability:** Unlike methods that require matrix
    inversion, the denominator $`w^T R w`$ is a quadratic form. It is
    numerically stable even if the LD matrix $`R`$ is singular or
    near-singular. Therefore, no ridge regularization is required.
2.  **LD Pruning (Optional):** While not required for numerical
    stability, LD pruning at $`r^2 < 0.2`$ can optionally be applied to
    prevent highly redundant variants from over-weighting the burden
    statistic, replicating the original RAS design.

## Weight Source Decision:

In the original individual algorithm, a 50/50 data-splitting protocol
provides an independent training set to fit weights and a testing set to
evaluate them, eliminating overfitting. Since summary-statistic
algorithms don’t have those individual-level splits, must choose between
two methods for defining $`w`$:

- **Method A:** Derive the weight vector $`w`$ from an independent,
  external discovery summary-statistic dataset (e.g., a large public
  study) and test it against the target cohort’s Z-scores. This is
  statistically rigorous because it avoids overfitting winner’s curse
  bias.
- **Method B:** If only a single summary-statistic dataset is available,
  deriving $`w`$ from the same marginal effects we are testing
  ($`w = \hat{\beta}`$) introduces severe winner’s curse bias, inflating
  the burden statistic. More practical for rarer diseases/phenotypes
  which don’t have much data available publicly.

While a joint-effect approach with LD reconstruction (e.g., SuSiE-RSS)
is a possible alternative, implementing it goes beyond the scope of
replicating the original methodology

## Validation:

1.  **Type I error test:** null simulation of the full algorithm
    (pruning and max-over-$`t`$ window selection), reporting empirical
    type I error, similar to Table 1 of the original paper.
2.  **Power test:** power simulation of full algorithm, reporting
    statistical power for comparison
3.  **Convergence validation:** compare summary-stat RAS output against
    individual-data RAS on the same simulated data (completed below),
    varying $`N`$ and LD-panel quality (yet to be done)

## Validation Results

Setup: 300-SNP toy chromosome, AR(1) LD at $`\rho = 0.8`$, true signal
at 3 consecutive causal SNPs (150–152, effect size 0.5). Discovery and
target cohorts of $`n = 1000`$ each (Method A), LD pruned at
$`r^2 < 0.2`$ (300 -\> 100 SNPs survived). The validated workflow is LD
pruning + `T_burden` + the package’s own unmodified
[`ras_detect()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/RAS/man/ras_detect.html) /
[`ras_validate()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/RAS/man/ras_validate.html)
changepoint detection.

Tuning: At package default of 5, the local slope re-check window is
located on the flat top of the signal’s plateau, so the slope looks weak
even when the global changepoint test runs correctly. Increasing it to 8
increased first-pass acceptance on true signal from ~17% to ~100%. With
`scw` fixed, the outer `window_size` was swept 6–20 at 100 reps per
size. Small windows are with low power because the test can’t see the
full causal cluster. Power increases steeply through 8 and 10, then
plateaus around 0.93–0.97 from `window_size = 12` on, while Type I error
stays around the nominal 0.05 line the whole way (never above 0.07). The
sweep metric (power $`-`$ Type I) thus picks `window_size = 12`.

Final parameters: `window_size = 12`, `slope_check_window_size = 8`,
`slope.p.values.threshold.left/right = 1e-3`, `p.value.threshold = 1e-3`
(the two thresholds taken from the package’s own `@examples` for a
similarly-sized toy profile).

Results at these parameters (three-run validation, see `02_simulation`):

| Run | Type I error (95% CI) | Power (95% CI) | Reps |
|----|----|----|----|
| ras-ss (this work) | 0.038 (0.023–0.059) | 0.935 (0.891–0.965) | 500 / 200 |
| Individual-level, same data (paired) | 0.036 (0.021–0.056) | 0.940 (0.898–0.969) | 500 / 200 |
| Individual-level, pure [`ras()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/RAS/man/ras.html) (`num_rep = 5`) | 0.010 (0.003–0.023) | 1.000 (0.982–1.000) | 500 / 200 |

CIs are exact binomial 95% intervals. Rows 1 and 2 share the same
simulated data per rep (same seed -\> same genotypes, phenotypes,
discovery weights, pruned windows, and CPD parameters), differing only
in the per-window statistic (summary-stat `T_burden` vs. the
individual-level `lm(phenotype ~ LPRS)` regression). Row 3 runs the
package’s shipped [`ras()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/RAS/man/ras.html) with
its published default `num_rep = 5`, exactly as a user would.

Reading the table by rows:

- **Rows 1 vs 2 demonstrates consistency:** On identical inputs the
  summary-stat statistic reproduced the same individual-level results on
  all but **1 of 200** signal reps (187 vs 188 localized to causal
  center) and all but **1 of 500** null reps (19 vs 18 false positives).
  That difference on each metric is the measured sacrifice of the
  summary-statistic substitution.
- **Rows 2 vs 3 shows the resampling-average benefit:** The 6-point
  power gap (0.940 → 1.000) is between two *individual-level* methods,
  so it isn’t a summary-statistic problem. Row 2 has the individual
  genotypes and phenotypes considered in calculation and still falls
  short. The true difference is between averaging 5 random splits
  (`num_rep = 5`) versus a single pass. (NOTE: row 3 also fits its
  weights on a 500-person internal split rather than row 2’s 1000-person
  external discovery set, so this is not a perfectly isolated
  comparison. That difference gives row 3 *noisier* weights, yet row 3
  still wins by 6 points, which is why the gap is attributed to the
  averaging, not the weight source.) The portion of this benefit that
  comes from re-splitting the *target* individuals is information that
  summary statistics do not contain, so no summary-statistic method can
  recover it. A reference-panel resampling analog (Monte Carlo
  resampling of the reference panel to obtain multiple burden profiles
  and average) can recover the *LD noise* portion. However, that portion
  is negligible in this simulation because the reference LD is estimated
  from 10,000 individuals, so the 6 points measured here are due to the
  unrecoverable target-resplit component. On real data with a smaller
  reference panel the analog may recover more. This is listed under Open
  items as the planned next experiment.
- **Type I error:** ras-ss at 0.038 is within the original paper’s own
  Table 1 range (0.042–0.050), so it is the well-calibrated row. Pure
  [`ras()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/RAS/man/ras.html) at 0.010 is actually
  *over-conservative* (below nominal 0.05 and below the paper’s range).
  Its lower false-positive rate also gives it perfect power, on the null
  side. All three rows are at or below the acceptable 0.05.
- **Peak location (the density plot in `02_simulation`):** All three
  runs center on the true causal center (151). The single-pass runs (1
  and 2) show small side-bumps at neighboring points where a noisier
  single-pass profile brought the validated peak one step off, a visual
  representation of the same averaging benefit, and the same open item.
  Edge-anchoring for ras-ss over the 200 power reps: 187 centered, 0
  landed on the trailing plateau edge without also hitting center, 13
  missed/snapped off-center.

Takeaway: ras-ss is not a replacement for the original method when
individual-level data is available. In that case, the 5-averaged
original remains the best option and is ~6 points more powerful, as per
above simulation. ras-ss is the method that runs on the studies the
original *cannot*: the summary-statistic-only majority of published
GWAS, where there are no target individuals to resplit. On matched data
with matched weights it sacrifices nothing to the individual-level
method (rows 1 vs 2). The gap from the original RAS is entirely the
resampling average, which is an inevitable loss in this summary-stat
only environment.

**Open items, not yet addressed:**

- Reference-panel LD is drawn from the same simulated population as the
  discovery/target cohorts here; ancestry-mismatch sensitivity (real
  reference panel vs. true cohort LD) has not yet been stress-tested.
- Calibration performed on a single toy configuration ($`n=300`$,
  $`\rho=0.8`$); has not been re-verified at other chromosome sizes or
  LD structures. (Done in simulation 3)
- Summary-stat resampling analog of `num_rep`: The three-run validation
  (`02_simulation`) measures the cost of being single-pass at ~6 power
  points vs. the 5-averaged original, all of it due to the resampling
  average. A reference-panel resampling analog is the planned way to
  recover the LD-noise portion of that gap on real data (negligible on
  this toy, where reference is large). Unfortunately, the target-resplit
  portion is unrecoverable from summary statistics without significant
  change of the method.
